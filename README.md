# Boonlificent

**Note:** Boonli has made some changes to their UI that broke the extension... and with COVID-19 and not working from the office for at least the near future (and therefore not using Boonli), I haven't had the motivation to fix or improve the extension. I'll unarchive this repo if we return to the office and using Boonli.

Auto payroll deduction helper for Boonli

## More Info

Boonli is a food service app that allows employees to order lunch through a company sponsored program (at least in my case; I think it can be used for many things).

Every time I order, I have to click a button to say that I'm using a payroll deduction as my payment option and then copy and paste the text "Payroll Deduction" into a field.

It's annoying so... I made this simple chrome extension to make that a thing of the past.
